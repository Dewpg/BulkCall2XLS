A simple python code to digest bulk ffiec data into a single sheet in xls.  Allowing for creation of charts and pivot tables that would otherwise be difficult to process.

To use this script, you must have python installed on your system.

Place the python script into an unzipped folder of single period bulk call report data downloaded from https://cdr.ffiec.gov/public/PWS/DownloadBulkData.aspx

Run script (can take as long as several minutes to process)
